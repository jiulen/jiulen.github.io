He invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. The game was named basketball as one of the players from the original first game, suggested to Naismith that the game be called "basketball", and    Naismith agreed as the game was played with a basket and a ball.</p>
